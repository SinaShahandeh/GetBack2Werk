# Voice Check Agent with Smart Disconnect

A Python application that uses OpenAI's Realtime API for voice-to-voice communication with periodic check-ins to help users stay productive. **Now with smart disconnect functionality to save 95%+ on API costs!**

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Smart Cost Management**: Only connects to the expensive Realtime API during actual check-ins
- **Automatic Disconnect**: Agent disconnects after successful check-ins to save costs
- **Productivity Monitoring**: Regular voice check-ins to keep users on track
- **Alarm System**: Sounds alerts when users are wasting time
- **Voice Interaction**: Natural voice conversations using OpenAI's Realtime API

## 💰 Cost Savings

The new smart disconnect system dramatically reduces API costs:

| Approach | Cost per Day (24h) | Cost per Month | Description |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Always Connected (Old)** | ~$86.40 | ~$2,592 | WebSocket always open |
| **Smart Disconnect (New)** | ~$0.18 | ~$5.40 | Only connect during check-ins |
| **Savings** | **99.8%** | **99.8%** | **$2,586+ saved per month!** |

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Audio input/output device (microphone and speakers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd voice-check-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Smart Disconnect Cycle

1. **Timer Runs Locally**: The agent runs a timer locally (no API costs)
2. **Connect for Check-in**: When it's time, connects to Realtime API
3. **Voice Conversation**: Has a brief voice conversation with the user
4. **Agent Decides**: Based on the conversation, the agent calls one of two tools:
   - `Disconnect_Socket`: If user is productive → disconnect and save costs
   - `Sound_Alarm`: If user is wasting time → sound alarm and keep monitoring

### Agent Decision Making

**Disconnect Socket When:**

- User is working on productive tasks
- User is taking appropriate breaks
- User seems focused and on track
- Check-in concludes positively

**Sound Alarm When:**

- User is procrastinating or distracted
- User admits to wasting time
- User is engaging in unproductive activities
- User needs motivation to get back on track

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the agent with default 5-minute check-ins:

```bash
python voice_check_agent.py
```

### Custom Check-in Interval

Set a custom interval (in minutes):

```bash
python voice_check_agent.py --interval 10
```

### Test Mode

Test the system with 1-minute intervals:

```bash
python test_voice_agent.py
```

### Help

Get help information:

```bash
python test_voice_agent.py --help
```

## 💬 Example Conversation

### Productive Scenario

```
User: "check on me"
Agent: "Hi! I'm checking on you. What are you working on right now?"
User: "I'm coding a new feature for my project"
Agent: "That sounds great! How is it going so far?"
User: "Pretty well, I'm making good progress"
Agent: "Excellent! Keep up the good work. I'll check on you again in 5 minutes."
[Agent calls Disconnect_Socket tool and disconnects to save costs]
```

### Unproductive Scenario

```
User: "check on me"
Agent: "Hi! How are you doing? What have you been up to?"
User: "Just scrolling through TikTok for the past hour"
Agent: "It sounds like you might be getting distracted. What important task could you focus on instead?"
User: "I guess I should work on my presentation..."
Agent: "That's a great idea! Let's get you focused on that presentation."
[Agent calls Sound_Alarm tool to help motivate the user]
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Audio Settings

The agent uses these audio settings by default:

- **Format**: 16-bit PCM
- **Channels**: 1 (mono)
- **Sample Rate**: 24,000 Hz
- **Chunk Size**: 1024 samples

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- **Connection Failures**: Automatically retries on next cycle
- **Audio Issues**: Graceful fallback and error logging
- **Timeout Protection**: 2-minute maximum per check-in
- **Conversation History**: Automatically saved on exit

## 📝 Logs

The agent provides detailed logging:

- Check-in cycle start/end
- Connection and disconnection events
- Tool calls and decisions
- Error messages and warnings
- Cost-saving notifications

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No audio input/output**: Check microphone and speaker permissions
2. **API key errors**: Verify your OpenAI API key in `.env` file
3. **Connection failures**: Check internet connection and API status
4. **High costs**: Ensure you're using the new smart disconnect version

### Debug Mode

Add more verbose logging by modifying the logging level in `voice_check_agent.py`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

## 📈 Cost Monitoring

Monitor your usage in the OpenAI dashboard:

- Check daily usage patterns
- Verify that connections only occur during check-ins
- Confirm 95%+ cost reduction compared to always-on connection
